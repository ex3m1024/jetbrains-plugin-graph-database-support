Release should be done carefully.

Be sure to check that plugin works before releasing!
To be executed straight on neueda/jetbrains-plugin-graph-database-support repository master branch.

One-time preparation:

    Go to travis-ci.org, go to settings for neueda/jetbrains-plugin-graph-database-support,
    enter and save these (names are self explanatory) environment variables:
    - INTELLIJ_USERNAME
    - INTELLIJ_PASSWORD
    Use credentials from Neueda robot account. The plugin will get published in the Jetbrains Plugin Repository

Commands:

    1) Push new release tag to github
    ./gradlew release
    The latest commit contains the next version, the previous one contains the state of the project
    that is being released right now

    1.1) After this step, wait for Travis to finish the build, and check if the plugin is
    published in the Jetbrains Plugin Repository.

    1.2) Go to GitHub, find latest released tag, edit comments, click 'publish', so that the release also appears on GitHub

If for some reason auto-publishing failed but projects , try manually:

    2.1) Checkout new release tag locally
    git checkout <new-release-tag>

    2.2) Clean everything
    ./gradlew clean

    2.3) Publish plugin to Jetbrains Plugin Registry
    Ensure {HOME}/.gradle/gradle.properties file contains intellij credentials
    intellijUsername=
    intellijPassword=
    Execute
    ./gradlew buildPlugin
    ./gradlew :graph-database-support-plugin:publishPlugin
